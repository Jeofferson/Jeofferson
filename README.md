I am currently studying at PHINMA University of Pangasinan as a third-year BSIT student Major in Systems Development with an extreme passion and dedication for my chosen specialization. I build websites, Android apps, iOS apps, mobile games, and do tons of coding stuff.

Outside of work, I'd spend my time helping to answer questions in forums and discussions. I also read articles, books, light novels, etc. I love to experiment with my ideas to explore new and trending technologies and am continuously honing my skills, always striving to learn something new each day.

On July 23, 2020, I was one of the 24 students in the Philippines selected by Google to be the Google Developer Student Club Lead for our respective campuses. I joined an amazing community of student leads who will be representing hundreds of colleges and universities across the globe. I believe that technology can do extraordinary things for the world, and I have taken on the responsibility to help students grow as developers and empower these students to impact their communities with technology. Through this experience I will not only be leaving a legacy of impact but also growing as an individual and contributing in a meaningful way to the greater developer ecosystem.

On August 29, 2020, I founded Developer Student Club PHINMA UPang. Powered by Google Developers, it is a group of students from PHINMA University of Pangasinan whose aim is to bridge the gap between theory and practical application for student developers. Together with the 1,266+ other DSC chapters in 106 countries around the world, it is part of a global community that is supported by Google Developers. DSC PHINMA UPang is also the only university-wide organization in PHINMA UPang that is officially recognized by Google. This community that I started is continuously organizing events that help aspiring developers get to know and learn the different Google technologies available to them.
